```bash

a?
```

Let’s examine the assembly code at
main by running the command
```
pdf @main
```

let’s set a breakpoint using the command, check and run
```
db address
#in this case, it would be
db 0x00400b55
pdf @main
# note the b next to the address, use dc to run
dc
```

read vars on runtime

```
#To view the contents of the local_ch variable, we use the following instruction
px @memory-address
```

next instruction
```
ds
```

To see the value of the %eax register, we can
use the command:

```
dr
```
