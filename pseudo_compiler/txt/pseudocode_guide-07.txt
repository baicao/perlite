1.4 Lines and line numbering

Where it is necessary to number the lines of pseudocode so that they can be referred to, line numbers are
presented to the left of the pseudocode with sufficient space to indicate clearly that they are not part of the
pseudocode statements.

Line numbers are consecutive, unless numbers are skipped to indicate that part of the code is missing. This will
also be clearly stated.

Each line representing a statement is numbered. However, when a statement runs over one line of text, the
continuation lines are not numbered.

1.5 Comments

Comments are preceded by two forward slashes //. The comment continues until the end of the line. For
multi-line comments, each line is preceded by //.

Normally the comment is on a separate line before, and at the same level of indentation as, the code it refers
to. Occasionally, however, a short comment that refers to a single line may be at the end of the line to which
it refers.

Example - comments

// this procedure swaps

// values of X and Y

PROCEDURE SWAP(BYREF X : INTEGER, Y : INTEGER)
Temp ← X // temporarily store X
xX ← -Y
Y ← Temp

ENDPROCEDURE
