Cambridge International AS & A Level Information Technology 9626 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers.

1 Pseudocode in examined components

The following information sets out how pseudocode will appear within the examined components and is
provided to allow you to give learners familiarity before the exam.

1.1 Font style and size

Pseudocode is presented in a monospaced (fixed-width) font such as Courier New. The size of the font will
be consistent throughout.

1.2 Indentation

Lines are indented (usually by three spaces) to indicate that they are contained within a statement in a
previous line. In cases where line numbering is used, this indentation may be omitted. Every effort will be
made to make sure that code statements are not longer than a line of text unless this is absolutely necessary.
Where necessary, continuation lines will be aligned to maximise readability.

1.3 Case

Keywords are in upper-case, e.g. IF, REPEAT, PROCEDURE. (Different keywords are explained in later
sections of this guide.)

Identifiers are in mixed case (sometimes referred to as camelCase or Pascal case) with upper-case letters
indicating the beginning of new words, for example NumberOfPlayers.

Meta-variables - symbols in the pseudocode that should be substituted by other symbols are enclosed in
angled brackets ← > (as in Backus-Naur Form). This is also used in this guide.

Example - meta-variables

REPEAT ← statement (s)>
UNTIL ← condition>
