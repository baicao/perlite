Cambridge International AS & A Level Information Technology 9626 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Variables, constants and data types

2.4 Variable declarations
It is good practice to declare variables explicitly in pseudocode.
Declarations are made as follows:

DECLARE ← identifier> : <data type>

Example - variable declarations

DECLARE Counter : INTEGER
DECLARE TotalToPay : REAL
DECLARE GameOver : BOOLEAN

2.5 Constants
It is good practice to use constants if this makes the pseudocode more readable, as an identifier is more
meaningful in many cases than a literal. It also makes the pseudocode easier to update if the value of the

constant changes.

Constants are normally declared at the beginning of a piece of pseudocode (unless it is desirable to restrict the
scope of the constant).

Constants are declared by stating the identifier and the literal value in the following format:

CONSTANT ← identifier> = <value>

Example - constant declarations

CONSTANT HourlyRate = 6.50
CONSTANT DefaultText = "N/A"

Only literals can be used as the value of a constant. A variable, another constant or an expression must never
be used.
