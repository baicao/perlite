Cambridge International AS & A Level Information Technology 9626 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers. Variables, constants and data types

4.2 Using user-defined data types

When a user-defined data type has been defined it can be used in the same way as any other data type in
declarations.

Variables of a user-defined data type can be assigned to each other. Individual data items are accessed using
dot notation.

Example - using user-defined data types

This pseudocode uses the user-defined types Student, Season and TInt Pointer defined in the
previous section.

DECLARE Pupill : Student

DECLARE Pupil2 : Student

DECLARE Form : ARRAY[1:30] OF Student
DECLARE ThisSeason : Season

DECLARE NextSeason : Season

DECLARE MyPointer : TIntPointer

Pupill.LastName ← "Johnson"
Pupill.Firstname ← "Leroy"
Pupill.DateOfBirth ← 02/01/2005
Pupill.YearGroup ← 6
Pupill.FormGroup ← 'A!

Pupil2 ← Pupill

FOR Index ← 1 TO 30
Form[Index].YearGroup ← Form[Index].YearGroup + 1
NEXT Index

ThisSeason ← Spring

MyPointer « “*ThisSeason

NextSeason ← MyPointer* + 1
