3 Arrays

Syllabus requirements

The Cambridge International AS & A Level syllabus (9618) requires candidates to understand and use both
one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

3.1 Declaring arrays

Arrays are considered to be fixed-length structures of elements of identical data type, accessible by
consecutive index (subscript) numbers. It is good practice to explicitly state what the lower bound of the array
(i.e. the index of the first element) is because this defaults to either 0 or 1 in different systems. Generally, a
lower bound of 1 will be used.

Square brackets are used to indicate the array indices.

A one-dimensional array is declared as follows:

DECLARE ← identifier>:ARRAY[<lower>:<upper>] OF <data type>

A two-dimensional array is declared as follows:

DECLARE ← identifier>:ARRAY [<lowerl>:<upperl>, <lower2>:<upper2>]
OF ← data type>

Example - array declarations

DECLARE StudentNames : ARRAY[1:30] OF STRING
DECLARE NoughtsAndCrosses : ARRAY[1:3,1:3] OF CHAR

3.2 Using arrays

Array index values may be literal values or expressions that evaluate to a valid integer value.

Example - accessing individual array elements

StudentNames[1] ← "Ali"
NoughtsAndCrosses[2,3] ← 'X
StudentNames [n+1] ← StudentNames[n]
