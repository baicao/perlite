Arrays can be used in assignment statements (provided they have same size and data type). The following is

therefore allowed:

Example - accessing a complete array

SavedGame ← NoughtsAndCrosses

A statement should not refer to a group of array elements individually. For example, the following
construction should not be used.

StudentNames [1 TO 30] <« ""

Instead, an appropriate loop structure is used to assign the elements individually. For example:

Example - assigning a group of array elements

FOR Index ← 1 TO 30
StudentNames [Index] <
NEXT Index
