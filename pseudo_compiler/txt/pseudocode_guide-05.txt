Cambridge International AS & A Level Information Technology 9626 Pseudocode Guide for Teachers.

Introduction

How should teachers use this guide?

We advise teachers to follow this guide in their teaching and make sure that learners are familiar with the
style presented here. This will enable learners to understand any pseudocode presented in examination papers
more easily. It will also give them a structure to follow so that they can present their algorithms more clearly
in pseudocode when required.

Learners should be encouraged to follow this guide in their examination answers or any other material they
present for assessment. By definition, pseudocode is not a programming language with a defined, mandatory
syntax. Any pseudocode presented by candidates will only be assessed for the logic of the solution presented
- where the logic is understood by the Examiner, and correctly solves the problem addressed, the candidate
will be given credit regardless of whether the candidate has followed the style presented here. However,
candidates are required to write pseudocode for questions that require answers in pseudocode and not a
programming language. Using a recommended style will enable the candidate to communicate their solution
to the Examiner more effectively.
